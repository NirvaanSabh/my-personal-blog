   In this image you can see that we were getting instructions to how to be standing and
    behaving infront of a dolphin. We had to wear proper swimming suits to go into the water.
  You will definatly have a good time if u decide to go!

    This movie has great graphic production and plot - despite much criticism from the concept
     that we grew up believing in Venom as a Supervillain. Honestly, it's more Fanservice than
      Canonical - although it still follows some aspects of Canon. It deserves the applause of 
      any other Marvel movie. The parasitic (bromantic) relationship between Eddie and his
       Symbiote is wonderful, hilarious, and appeals to audiences who love this kind of content.
       Fans must surely recognize that this film is one of the best fanserve mega-productions i
       n the movie industry. I certainly recognize and love it. ALSO, we must not fail to consider
        that there may be a new Venom, just as there may be a new Carnage, a Toxin, Hybrid, Anti
        -Venom, and so on, in future films. So we don't need to criticize this good work that achieved 
        its purpose and ended up as it should we just have to hope that a new Venom appears and quenches
         our thirst for the evil, vengeful, selfish, killer and lunatic alien.

I'm so glad I kicked off my diwali on a dhamakedar üí• note with #Sooryavanshi , great plot ,
 action choreography especially in the climax is really great , lot of nicely choreographed
  shootout & combat sequences , the music too especially the thumping background music felt
   great to hear in the theater & #KatrinaKaif surprises in a really awesome attention grabbing 
   , superbly & sensually performed dance moves in a really nice updated version of #TipTipBarsa
   Pani . The character , plot driven moments as well as the emotional & humorous moments are rea
   lly nice & nicely balanced . It also makes an attempt at tugging at your anti terrorism & reli
   gious sentiments & rightfully succeeds in that department . Entire supporting cast including @G
   ulshanGroverGG & others really make an impact with whatever screen time
them . Nice 1st half even better 2nd half as the ATS are in a race against time
 to diffuse a bunch bombs . The presence of Singham & Simba in the climax is nic
 ely weaved & is a moneyshot moment that elevates the concluding portions of the
  movie . Singham's brief standalone moment in the climax is really nice which is
   a teaser to #Singham3 . This is @iamrohitshetty 's best movie yet I wonder how
    he'll top it off in the next installment of the universe looking forward to it üëç
